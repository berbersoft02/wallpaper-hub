      <h2>The Elf Who Lived a Thousand Years</h2>
      <p><em>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</em> (Sousou no Frieren) has visually redefined what a fantasy anime can look like. The soft lighting, the watercolor-style backgrounds, and the intricate character designs are a masterpiece.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8 relative w-full aspect-video rounded-lg overflow-hidden border-2 border-neon-cyan/50 shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(5,217,232,0.3)]">

      </div>

      <h2>Capturing the Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>For this drop, I wanted to focus on the <strong>atmosphere</strong> of the show. It's not just about action scenes; it's about the quiet moments. Frieren reading a grimoire by a campfire, Fern pouting, Stark engaging a dragon.</p>

      <h3>Collection Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frieren in the Flower Field:</strong> A serene, upscaled 4K shot of Frieren surrounded by the blue moon weed flowers. Perfect for a calming desktop setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Fern's Magic:</strong> Capturing the sheer particle density of Fern's Zoltraak spell. The contrast between the dark forest and the bright blue magic makes this one pop on OLED screens.</li>
        <li><strong>The Party:</strong> Group shots of the new party walking towards the northern lands.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Edited These</h2>
      <p>The anime uses a very soft, almost hazy filter. To make these suitable for wallpapers, I had to carefully sharpen the line art without destroying that painterly look. I utilized a custom "Smart Sharpen" filter in Photoshop and slightly boosted the vibrance of the greens and blues to match the "Only_dias" aesthetic.</p>

      <h2>The Pink Haired Icon</h2>
      <p>It's been years since <em>Darling in the Franxx</em> aired, but <strong>Zero Two</strong> remains unmatched in the wallpaper community. Her character design—the pink hair, the red horns, the uniform—was practically built for aesthetic edits.</p>

      <div class="my-8 relative w-full aspect-[9/16] max-w-sm mx-auto rounded-lg overflow-hidden border-2 border-neon-pink/50 shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(255,42,109,0.3)]">

      </div>

      <h2>My Editing Approach</h2>
      <p>When I edit Zero Two, I lean heavily into the <strong>Neon Pink</strong> and <strong>Cyan</strong> color scheme. This "vaporwave" palette complements her design perfectly.</p>
      <p>For this specific wallpaper shown above, I isolated her from the original background and placed her against a custom glitch-art texture. I added a slight chromatic aberration effect (shifting the red and blue channels) to give it that "cyberpunk anime" feel.</p>
      
      <p>You can find 10+ variations of Zero Two in the <a href="/#gallery">gallery below</a>!</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Color Grading for Marin</h2>
      <p>Unlike the moody, dark edits I do for other characters, Marin requires <strong>brightness</strong>. I use a "warm" color grading curve, boosting the oranges and yellows to highlight her blonde hair and gradient eyes.</p>
      <p>I also apply a "Soft Light" blending mode layer with a warm orange fill at 20% opacity to give the whole image a golden hour glow.</p>

      <p>Let's be honest: Gojo Satoru's eyes are the most beautiful thing in modern anime animation. MAPPA went all out, and so did I for these wallpapers.</p>

      <div class="my-8 relative w-full aspect-[9/16] max-w-sm mx-auto rounded-lg overflow-hidden border-2 border-blue-500/50 shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(59,130,246,0.3)]">

      </div>

      <h2>The "Infinite" Edit</h2>
      <p>For Gojo, I focus on <strong>contrast</strong>. His domain expansion is void and dark, but his energy is bright blue. I use a "Linear Dodge (Add)" layer style in Photoshop to make his technique glow intensely against the black background.</p>
      <p>This collection features him both with the blindfold (mysterious vibes) and without it (god-mode vibes).</p>

      <h2>My Editing Secret Sauce</h2>
      <p>Ever wondered how I create the smooth anime edits and static artwork you see on my TikTok channel? It's not just about slapping a filter on an image. It's about composition, color grading, and finding the perfect scene.</p>

      <h2>The Tools I Use</h2>
      <p>My workflow relies heavily on two main tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop:</strong> This is where the magic happens for high-quality upscaling, background removal, and complex color adjustments. I use it to clean up raw anime screenshots and turn them into 4K masterpieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Canva:</strong> Believe it or not, Canva is amazing for quick layouts and adding typography. When I'm making PFP sets or promotional thumbnails for the site, Canva speeds up my workflow significantly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>From Screenshot to Wallpaper</h2>
      <p>I start by hunting for high-quality RAW anime episodes. Once I find a frame I like, I take a screenshot and bring it into Photoshop. I use AI upscaling to get it to 4K resolution, then I manually fix any artifacts. Finally, I add my signature neon glow effects that you all know and love.</p>

      <h2>Why Matching PFPs?</h2>
      <p>Matching profile pictures (PFPs) are the ultimate way to show your bond with your duo, whether it's your gaming partner or your significant other. On my channel, the "Matching Icons" videos are some of the most requested content.</p>

      <h2>The Design Process</h2>
      <p>Creating a good matching set isn't just about cutting an image in half. I look for scenes where characters are interacting—looking at each other, holding hands, or fighting back-to-back.</p>
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Selection:</strong> I find a wide shot containing two characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Crop & Center:</strong> using Photoshop, I crop the image into two perfect squares (1:1 ratio).</li>
        <li><strong>Color Matching:</strong> I use Canva to ensure the color grading matches perfectly between both icons so they look cohesive on your discord or TikTok profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> I sharpen the eyes and boost the saturation to make them pop on small mobile screens.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
      <p>My goal with <strong>Only_dias Ocean</strong> is to provide the highest quality anime wallpapers on the internet. I'm tired of seeing blurry, pixelated JPEGs. That's why every single image on this site is manually curated and upscaled.</p>

      <h2>Requesting Characters</h2>
      <p>I read all your comments on TikTok! The latest addition of <em>Rias Gremory</em> and <em>Zero Two</em> came directly from your suggestions. I look for characters that have a strong aesthetic and fit the "Neon/Dark" vibe of the website.</p>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>I'm currently working on a new "Live Wallpapers" collection featuring animated loops made in After Effects. Stay tuned to the channel for the release announcement!</p>

      <h2>No Subs, No Problems</h2>
      <p>One of the most common questions I get in my TikTok comments is: <em>"Where do you find anime clips without subtitles?"</em> The truth is, editing with hard-subbed footage is a nightmare. It ruins the immersion and limits where you can crop.</p>
      
      <h2>My Sourcing Strategy</h2>
      <p>I stick to "RAW" torrents or specific archive sites that host the Blu-ray versions of episodes. Blu-ray releases are far superior to TV broadcasts because they often fix animation errors and have a higher bitrate.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Bitrate Matters</h3>
      <p>When you edit in Photoshop or After Effects, you're going to be applying effects, color correction, and re-rendering. If your source file is already compressed (low bitrate), your final result will look blocky. Always start with the highest quality file possible!</p>

      <h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
      <p>There's a weird debate online about Photoshop vs. Canva. As a creator, I say: <strong>use both</strong>. They serve completely different purposes in my content creation pipeline.</p>

      <h2>Photoshop: The Heavy Lifter</h2>
      <p>I use Adobe Photoshop for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolating Subjects:</strong> The pen tool and Magic Wand are still unbeaten for cutting characters out of backgrounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting Effects:</strong> Adding that "glow" or neon rim light to a character requires the precise brush and blending mode controls Photoshop offers.</li>
        <li><strong>Upscaling:</strong> Dealing with 4K resolutions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Canva: The Speed Demon</h2>
      <p>Once the heavy editing is done, I move to Canva for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thumbnails:</strong> Dragging and dropping my edited PNGs into templates.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Canva has an amazing library of fonts that look great on mobile screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Batching:</strong> Making 10 variations of a PFP set takes minutes in Canva, but much longer in Photoshop.</li>

      <h2>Typography Makes or Breaks the Edit</h2>
      <p>You can have a perfect 4K wallpaper, but if you slap boring text on it, the vibe is ruined. Over the years, I've curated a list of go-to fonts in Canva that scream "Anime Aesthetic".</p>

      <h2>The List</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Manga Temple:</strong> Perfect for that comic book / manga dialogue look. It feels authentic and hand-lettered.</li>
        <li><strong>Tan Meringue:</strong> A retro, bubbly font that fits perfectly with 90s anime edits (think Sailor Moon vibes).</li>
        <li><strong>Cyberpunk:</strong> Sharp, jagged edges. Essential for any dark/neon edits or tech-heavy characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Pangram:</strong> A super clean sans-serif that looks modern and professional. Great for subtitles or minimalist info.</li>
        <li><strong>Gagalin:</strong> Loud and punchy. I use this for my YouTube thumbnails or when I need text to grab attention on TikTok fyp.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Try mixing these up in your next edit and see the difference!</p>

      <h2>The "Only_dias" Look</h2>
      <p>If you scroll through my website, you'll notice a theme: deep blacks, vibrant cyans, and hot pinks. This isn't an accident; it's a specific color palette I've tuned over time.</p>

      <h2>The Curve is Key</h2>
      <p>In Photoshop, I almost always start with an <strong>S-Curve</strong> on the Curves adjustment layer. I crush the shadows (bring the bottom left point slightly to the right) to make the darks look "inky" rather than gray. This makes the bright colors pop way more.</p>

      <h2>Selective Color</h2>
      <p>This is the secret weapon. I go into the "Selective Color" adjustment layer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blues:</strong> I push the cyan slider up and remove yellow. This gives that icy, electric blue look.</li>
        <li><strong>Magentas:</strong> I boost the saturation to turn dull reds into neon pinks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't be afraid to push the sliders to the extreme, then dial back the opacity of the layer until it looks right!</p>

      <h2>High Tech, Low Life</h2>
      <p>Cyberpunk isn't just a game; it's a visual language that anime has spoken for decades. From <em>Akira</em> to <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, and now <em>Edgerunners</em>, the genre defines cool.</p>

      <h2>Why It Works for Wallpapers</h2>
      <p>For desktop customization, Cyberpunk is king. Why? <strong>Lighting.</strong></p>
      <p>Most gaming setups are RGB-heavy. When you have a keyboard glowing red and a mouse glowing blue, a wallpaper that features rainy city streets, neon signs, and dark shadows bridges the gap between your physical room and your digital screen. It feels immersive.</p>

      <p>That's why I prioritize uploading wallpapers with strong contrast and neon elements—they just look better on your setup!</p>

      <h2>Sound Selection</h2>
      <p>50% of the edit is the audio. I spend hours scrolling through my FYP just saving sounds. I look for audios with clear "beat drops" where I can sync a scene transition. If the audio is trending, you're already halfway to a viral video.</p>
